## Future Improvements
Possible features:
* Allow users to add each other to their friends list
  * Pull friends chats first when retrieving chat rooms 
* Add more user features such as permissions, allowing users to be moderators of a chat room
* More robust deletion
  * Delete all content when a user deletes their profile

Technical:
* Change timestamp of messages to not use system millis
  * Depending on the data center distribution, system millis might need to be "normalized" across data centers
* Dockerize the service
* If we want a real time chat, would probably need to use sockets
* Finish tests

## Design Explanation
### Flow
The API makes some assumptions about the flow of the calls from clients. 
To start, the user would need to be created before we start populating messages with
an id. Therefore, by the time we start saving messages, we assume the client has validated 
that the ids are valid. We also assume that the client has created a chat room with the other 
user at some point before. I decided to make a separate table that held the chat room and 
user association, in the hopes to be more flexible in the future. Doing so, I was hoping
that a chat room could hold multiple users.
